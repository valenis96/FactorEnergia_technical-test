# Technical Test

This project is a tecnical test for FactorEnergia.
Inside you can find:
- A login page where, if you enter incorrect credentials, a snackbar is shown to display the error. The inputs are required, so validation errors are shown if the form is empty.
  ```bash
  Correct credentials:
  email: val.maronese@gmail.com
  password: 123
  ```

- A page where it is possible to view your personal data and edit it through the “Edit personal data” button, which opens a dialog with a form containing the data you can modify.

- A page where all the invoices are listed. The first invoice is opened by default, with its details shown on the left and the PDF displayed on the right. I used the pdfviewer.net library, which provides several features, including the ability to download the PDF.
